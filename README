The makefile is unaltered. To compile hanoi.cc, simply type 
'make hanoi' into the console. To compile hanoi_it.cc, type
'make hanoi_it' into the console. The hanoi_it version is 
an interative version of the same function.



Personally, I believe that the interative version of the function 
provides more clarity. However, I feel that if you were trying to 
demonstrate both functions to a person not experienced in computer
programming, they would understand the non-interative approach much 
better. In addition, I didn't notice any performance differences 
between the non-iterative approach and the iterative approach. Although,
I do feel it is easier to demonstrate correctness of the algorithm when
using the iterative approach.
